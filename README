It is a very simple code to set alarm when the stock price exceeds to the threshold to sell or drops beneath threshold to buy.

I am using the app IFTTT to send notification to my phone, the setting procesure as follows:
1. Choose the “webhooks” service and select the “Receive a web request” trigger
2. Name the event stock_price_emergency
3. For the action select the “Notifications” service and select the “Send a rich notification from the IFTTT app” action
4. Give it a title, like “Stock price emergency!”
5. Set the message: The bid price is at ${{Value1}}. The ask price is at ${{Value1}}. You can take action now.
6. Create the action and finish setting up the applet

Three packages are required in your environment:
1. yfinance
2. requests
3. sys
